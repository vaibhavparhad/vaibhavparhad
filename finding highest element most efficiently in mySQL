finding highest element most efficiently in mysql

>>>>>lets find the highest salary by department
theen we can find others easily
 
 but first you will have to find the highest and 2nd highest salaries
 
we can get max (highest) or min(lowest) record in the database table very easily by using the

max() function or min() function 



this means finding the third highest value , not overall bt within each subset , where a subset has the salaries , where a subset has salary for a given department the most helpful tool for doing this is the window function

we are going to learn how we can select the nth highest record in a database table with the help of various technique


create database nested_query 
use nested_query 
create table Nested_Query(
e_id int not null,
f_name varchar(40),
l_name varchar(40),
dept varchar (40) not null,
city varchar (40),
salary float not null);

insert into Nested_Query values
(001,'nichole','smith','data sciance','denver',65000),
(002,'smith','carter','data sciance','toronto',75000),
(003,'anna','frazer','deep learning','dallas',79000),
(004,'kamila','kender', 'arts', 'nashville', 69000),
(005, 'dave', 'simpson', 'machine learning', 'oregon', 95000),
(006, 'kelsey', 'davis', 'software testing', 'denver', 95000),
(007, 'ashley', 'govtte', 'management', 'colorado', 115000),
(008, 'frank', 'ross', 'management', 'denver', 110000),
(009, 'arnold', 'smith', 'data science', 'london', 105000);

<<< lets check the table using select *>>>>
select * from Nested_Query;

<<<<<<< comand>>>>
<< provide - highest salary output>>
select salary from Nested_Query
where salary = (select max(salary) from Nested_Query);
               <<or>>
select max(salary) from Nested_Query
where salary <> (salary<>(select max(salary) from Nested_Query));

      >>>>>>display all salary except highest
select salary from Nested_Query
where
salary <> (select max(salary) from Nested_Query);
             
             ##2nd highest salary##
select distinct salary from Nested_Query
order by salary desc limit 1 offset 1;

     >>>>>>>>3rd highest salary>>>>>>
select distinct salary from Nested_Query
order by salary desc limit 1 offset 2;

   <<<<< 4th highest salary>>>>
select distinct salary from Nested_Query
order by salary desc limit 1 offset 3 ;
